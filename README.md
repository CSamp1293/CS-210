Project Three: Corner Grocer

1. The main goal of the Corner Grocer project was to incorporate and item-tracking program that met all required functionality. This included, a menu with options. Option 1 is the item search portion which allows a user to look-up or search for a specific item and return its frequency in a provided text document ("CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt). Menu option 2 displays all items and their frequencies, while option 3 also displys all items and their frequencies, but in the form of a histogram. Option 4 allows the user to properly exit the application while also creating a file ("frequency.dat"). Along with these functions, while using the application, everything is written to the file "frequency.dat".

2. I feel i did particularly well on implementing mapping in my code as it wasn't nessacary, but highly recommended. It took a few attempts and some trial and error, but eventually I was able to implement it properly.

3. There is definitely many ways to enhance the code produced. One such example is including more failsafes for validation. Particularly, I could improve upon casing for user input. While Apple is on the list, apple is not, even though the casing for either should be an acceptable input.

4. Writing the mapping portion of the code was the most challenging bit by far. Through the lesson on mapping in zyBooks and a few videos and google searches, I was able to properly use mapping within the code.

5. Realistically, all parts of this project are useful skills to take away and use in future projects. But, in particular, mapping is definitely a very useful skill to have some knowledge on now.

6. Through a lot of trial and error with different parts of the code I feel I was able to produce a readable, maintainable code. As well as trial and error, I did a lot of test cases for this program to ensure every spect is covered to the best of my abilities.
